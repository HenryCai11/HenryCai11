- 👋 Hi, I’m @HenryCai11
- 👀 I have broad interests in NLP, and I currently work on [interpreting LLMs from their representations](http://llm-self-control.github.io/), and [building better LLM game agents](http://llm-strategist.github.io/). Conversely, I'd like to explore using neural networks to better understand human nature, which I consider my long-term mission.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a Ph.D position for Fall 2025.
- 📖 Here is the link to my [CV](./CV_CM.pdf). Please feel free to reach out if you're interested!
- 📫 How to reach me: henry_f_miller@163.com or caimin2021@email.szu.edu.cn
