- 👋 Hi, I’m @HenryCai11, Min Cai (蔡旻)
- 👀 I have broad interests in ML and NLP, particularly in understanding the mechanisms behind neural language models
(LMs) for better control [(e.g., SelfControl)](http://llm-self-control.github.io/), developing LLM agents capable of solving complex problems[(e.g., Strategist)](http://llm-strategist.github.io/), and enhancing LLM reasoning abilities. **Currently, my primary focus is on both inference-time and post-training algorithms for alignment and reasoning in LLMs.**
- 🌱 I previously obtained a BA in Translation from Beijing Language and Culture University, and an MS in CS from Shenzhen University.
- 🏠 My personal webpage is at: https://henrycai11.github.io
